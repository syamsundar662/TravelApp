    "Paithalmala is a popular trekking destination. There are two trekking seasons at Paithalmala: monsoon and summer. Trekking in Paithalmala can be challenging due to frequent rain, leeches, and occasional elephant visits.Monsoon is followed by a cool climate in Paithalmala and the grass surrounding the hills grow to their fullest size, making it difficult to walk through. As they grow above seven feet, finding the regular way becomes a difficult task. By December, the forest caretakers set fire to the grass, taking care of the rest of the forest, to ease out the trekking experience. Soon after this, the hill becomes unsuitable to trek because of the black sooth formed but clears away after a couple of weeks. Most people generally trek between January and March.",
